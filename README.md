## Getting Started :muscle:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites :runner:
* [Java11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - The DBMS used.
* [Maven3](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management for java
* [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Runtime and Dependency Management for Javascript
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Dependency Management for Javascript

### Installing :nut_and_bolt:

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Maven will install dependencies as they are needed for commands.
But yarn first needs to be told to install them:
```sh
yarn
```` 
Now we can build the code:
```sh
yarn build
```
and upload the target/ROOT.war file to a tomcat server

After running the server you can get data from the api.
Disclaimer: this request will fail without a token.
```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/user/1  
```

## Watching/Serving files üëÄüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Automatically build and serve the app on file change:
```sh
yarn serve
```
Automatically run tests on file change:
```sh
yarn test-watch
```

## Running the tests :tada:

Here is how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Unit Tests
To run unit tests we use the maven `test` lifecycle.
```sh
yarn test
```

### Integration Tests
Make sure you have the client side build.
And run the testing server: (note running this command will not build the client code).
```sh
yarn serve-test
```

then you can run the integration tests:
```sh
yarn integration
```

### Checkstyle

To run checkstyle on the project we use maven to create 
the checkstyle report.
```
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

## Deployment :ship:
### deploy to Previder
Create a tomcat server with tomcat version 8.5.64
Unfold the server tab until you see Deployments
Hover over deployments and click "Deploy Archive".
Click browse, select target/Root.war and click open.
Set Context to ROOT and click deploy.


### To deploy to Heroku:
make sure the heroku cli is installed
login to heroku:
```sh
heroku login
```
and deploy
```
mvn heroku:deploy-war
```
