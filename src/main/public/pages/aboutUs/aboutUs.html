    <h1 class="title">The Story of topicus</h1>
    <p>This is our story. The Story of Topicus. About what we want to achieve and who we are. We really want
    to mean something for society. Making an impact. With 1,000 smart colleagues. Using technology. How? We connect
    people, systems and data in platforms. Because that is our basis. And with that we can really achieve something.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Our Story</h1>
    <p>We simply want to make people's lives better, both personally and professionally. 
We do this by empowering people and giving them control in areas they come into contact with on a daily basis. 
That is why we work on optimal care, clarity and insight into finances and reliable and high-quality education.</p>
    
    <h1 class="title">Walk ahead</h1>
    <p>With our idiosyncratic, social and connecting character, we actively change the markets ourselves. We want 
        to do business, renew and innovate together with customers. We question traditional and outdated (work) processes 
        and take a critical look at existing chains. How do we connect those IT systems so that everyone knows what is 
        going on? No IT islands, but one platform in which everyone can participate without unnecessary intermediaries.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Impact with IT</h1>
    <p>With IT we make the impossible, possible. With innovative software platforms, digital ecosystems, in which people 
        are central. Platforms in which we connect people, data and systems. In this way we ensure that people have the 
        financing for their dream home within one day, that children receive the education that matches their talent and 
        ambition, that families receive the right help with problems and that dangerous diseases are detected at an early 
        stage and thus appearance.</p>
